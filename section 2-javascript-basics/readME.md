## JAVASCRIPT VERSIONS

### BRIEF HISTORY OF JS

- JavaScript was first released in 1995 under name "LiveScript"

- 1996: changed it's name from "liveScript" to "JavaScript" just for marketing reasons

- 1997: - submitted to organization called "ECMA-international" to create new standard - ES1(ECMAScript1) bacame the first version of JS language Standard. - ECMAScript: The language Standard. - JavaScript: The language in practice.

- 2005: - ES5(ECMAScript 5) was released with lots of new features. - Fully supported in all browser

- 2015: - ES6/ES2015 was released: it was _the biggest update to language_ ever! - changed to annual cycle

- 2016/2017/2018/2019/...: Release of ES2016/ES2017/ES2018/ES2019

#### TRANSPILING AND POLYFILLING

Modern JavaScript versions such ES6 and up are not supported in older browser.
So the solution is to convert these modern JS versions back to ES5 by the process called Transpiling and polyfilling.
